#Performance tunning using Bitmap

- Created a new class BitmapDecoder which calculates the    required size of image and decodes the new sample size. This makes a large image to be decoded to display on imageView with required width and height thus allocating little heap memory instead of whole large image size.

- Improved scrolling. 

#Before Release mode

- Solved all tiny errors 

- Added sample in-app billing logic.
